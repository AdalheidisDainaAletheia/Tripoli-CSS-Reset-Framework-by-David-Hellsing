> The originally Tripoli CSS Reset Framework consisted of multiple stylesheets including the base, a simple version, Internet Explorer versions, visuals, and type. Though there are some simplified versions available on the web, the original version seems to be forgotten and set aside.
> 
> I have cleaned and modified the original version, removing outdated elements and validating each stylesheet. Though this is mostly for reference, it has been modified for actual use. However, this particular reset is very flat and boring visually as it is.
> 
> I have also included an HTML page to view all elements, based on HTML5 Kitchen Sink at https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink
> 
> The only thing missing from the original reset is the deprecated elements and some comments.
> 
> Hopefully, this will be useful for anyone looking for the original version in an updated package.
